# DiamondShop
A simple Spigot plugin to allow for chest-based diamond shops!

On a sign placed on a chest write

Shop

(number) (selling material)

(number) (diamond/diamonds)

(name of shop owner)



Just right click the sign with diamonds in your hand to buy!

Shops cannot be removed or opened by players not on the last line

Admin can remove with /fill or similar replacement command

If an item doesn't fit the name, put as much as you can and it will search for that.

EX = Firework_Rock for Firework_Rocket

Please leave any issues in the github!

To increase the max shop limit, go to the config.yml

Set it to 0 to have infinite shops
